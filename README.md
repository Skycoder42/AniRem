## Features
Proxer is awesome, but misses one feature: A notification when a new season/ova/etc is released for an anime you have already watched. This tools purpose is to do exactly that. You can

- Add Animes you have watched
- Activate automatic season checks
	- The app notifies you when a new season/... gets released
- Available for all desktop platforms and android (no iOS version due to API limitations & high appstore fees)

## Installation
There are multiple ways to get the application:

1. Arch Linux users: Have an AUR package: [`anirem`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/anirem/)
2. All platforms: Download the installer/apk from the [release page](https://github.com/Skycoder42/SeasonProxer/releases)
3. Android: While the apk is available as direct download, you can also get it via google play store: [Ani-Rem Google Play](www.example.com)
